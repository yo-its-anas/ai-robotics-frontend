# Part II: ROS 2 - The Robotic Nervous System

## Part Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is the de facto standard middleware for robot development. This part teaches you to build robot software using ROS 2's pub-sub architecture, Python development, URDF modeling, and control systems.

## Chapters in This Part

### Chapter 5: ROS 2 Fundamentals
Core architecture, nodes, topics, services, actions, and DDS communication.

### Chapter 6: Building with ROS 2 & Python
Workspace setup, writing nodes, launch files, parameters, and ROS bags.

### Chapter 7: Robot Description with URDF
Creating robot models in URDF/XML, links, joints, and visualization.

### Chapter 8: Control Systems for Humanoids
Controllers, PID, trajectories, and the ROS 2 control stack.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing Part II, you will:
1. **Design** ROS 2 node architectures with proper communication patterns
2. **Implement** Python nodes for robot behaviors
3. **Create** URDF robot models for simulation
4. **Configure** control systems for actuator management

## Time Commitment
**Total for Part II**: 28-36 hours (7-9 hours per chapter)

## Next Steps
