## Not Suited For

To set proper expectations, this textbook is **NOT ideal** for:

### Absolute Beginners

If you have:
- No programming experience → Start with Python fundamentals first
- No Linux familiarity → Learn basic command-line skills first
- No math background → Study linear algebra and calculus first

**Recommended preparation**:
- Complete a Python course (Coursera, Udacity, etc.)
- Set up Ubuntu and practice basic terminal commands
- Review Khan Academy linear algebra and calculus

### Industry Practitioners Seeking Quick Reference

This is a **learning textbook**, not a reference manual. If you need:
- Quick API documentation → Use official ROS 2/Isaac Sim docs
- Production deployment guides → See vendor documentation
- Troubleshooting for specific hardware → Consult product manuals

**Better resources**:
- [ROS 2 Documentation](https://docs.ros.org/)
- [NVIDIA Isaac Sim Docs](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/)
- Hardware vendor support forums

## Learning Commitment

### Time Investment

**Per Chapter** (average):
- Reading: 1-2 hours
- Implementation tutorials: 2-3 hours
- Lab exercises: 2-4 hours
- **Total: 5-9 hours per chapter**

**Full Course** (27 chapters):
- Total time: 135-245 hours
- Typical semester: 3-4 hours/week for 13-15 weeks
- Intensive bootcamp: 4-6 weeks full-time

### Hardware Investment

See [Requirements Overview](./requirements.md) for detailed costs.

**Minimum** (simulation only): $1,500-2,500
- Development workstation with RTX GPU
- No physical robot required

**Recommended** (sim + edge): $2,500-4,000
- Development workstation
