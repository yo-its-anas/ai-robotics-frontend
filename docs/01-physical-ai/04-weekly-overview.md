# Chapter 4: Course Overview

## Overview

This chapter maps the complete 13-week learning journey from foundational concepts through capstone project.

**Estimated Time**: 3 hours

## Course Structure

### Weekly Progression

**Weeks 1-2: Foundations (Part I)**

- Control systems
- *Milestone*: Working ROS 2 nodes and robot model

**Weeks 6-7: Simulation (Part III)**
- Gazebo setup and operation
- Humanoid simulation
- Unity visualization
- *Milestone*: Simulated walking humanoid

**Weeks 8-9: NVIDIA Isaac (Part IV)**
- Isaac Sim introduction

**Weeks 13-15: Capstone (Part VII)**
- System architecture design
- Full integration
- Sim-to-real transfer
- Testing and evaluation
- *Milestone*: Voice-driven autonomous humanoid

## Learning Outcomes

By course end, you will:
1. Design and implement ROS 2 robot systems
2. Simulate humanoids in Gazebo and Isaac Sim
3. Integrate voice and language models for control
4. Deploy AI models to edge devices (Jetson)
5. Transfer learned policies from simulation to hardware

## Assessment Strategy

- **Labs** (40%): Weekly hands-on exercises
- **Midterm Project** (25%): ROS 2 + Simulation integration
- **Final Capstone** (30%): Complete voice-controlled system
- **Participation** (5%): Discussions and peer review
