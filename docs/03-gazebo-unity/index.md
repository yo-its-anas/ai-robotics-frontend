# Part III: Gazebo & Unity Simulation

## Part Overview

Simulation is essential for developing Physical AI systems safely and efficiently. This part covers Gazebo (physics simulation) and Unity (high-fidelity visualization).

## Chapters
- **Ch 9**: Gazebo architecture, SDF, physics engines
- **Ch 10**: Simulating humanoids, testing locomotion
- **Ch 11**: Unity-ROS bridge, visualization

## Learning Outcomes
1. Configure Gazebo worlds and robot models
2. Simulate humanoid walking and balance
3. Integrate Unity for photorealistic rendering
4. Test robot behaviors before hardware deployment

**Time**: 18-24 hours total

**Next**: [Chapter 9: Gazebo Introduction](./09-gazebo-intro.md)
